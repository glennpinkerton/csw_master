This directory has scripts used to build the software.

There are three executable scripts and three .mk files:

  build_csw     Clean all previous build output and do a full build from scratch.
                On my system, this takes 5 minutes or so.

  clean_csw     Clean all previous build output without a new build.

  ncb_csw       "No Clean Build"  Build without a clean.  This works pretty
                well if no header files have been changed.  I tend to use 
                this most of the time, and use build_csw if I am going to be 
                away for a few minutes while the build is going on.

  linux.mk      This is the "master or global" make file for linux.  In this
                version of the build scripts, linux.mk is identical to system.mk.

  system.mk     This is the file that is included in each makefile used to
                build the software.  The idea is to copy either linux.mk or
                win32.mk into this file to build on either system.  Right now,
                the win32.mk include has not been used for 10 years and it will
                not work.

  win32.mk      Old include file for win32 makes.  This does not work, but it is
                kept with the possibility of getting it to work some time.



So, only the linux build currently works.  Here are versions of various linux
"system" programs used in the build process.

This is not intended to be a tutorial on finding and installing and setting up
these "system" programs.  I leave all this as an "exercise for the student".
