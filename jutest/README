This is where I will put various junit test runnig classes.

Currently the only runner class is RunJutilTests.  The RunAllTests
class is just a thin wrap to execute any other test runner classes
located here.

Log4jTestWatcher is a class to get testing output written into the
logger files (located in the csw_master directory, one level above
this jutest directory.
