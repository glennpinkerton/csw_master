The "playback" files for ezx_test or sw_test are here, 
using the terms utest and swutest respectively in the
file names.  The original output prim files are the prim
and swprim files with .orig extensions.

To make a new output file, run the utility test_new_ez filenum
or test_new_sw filenum.  For example:

    test_new_ez 1   will use utest_1.orig as input and
                    write prim_1.new as output.

    test_new_sw 1   will use swutest_1.orig as input and
                    write swprim_1.new as output.
