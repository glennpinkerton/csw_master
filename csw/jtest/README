The tester script can be used to run a java test program as follows.

    ./tester javaclass

Currently the only two classes in this directory that work are

    JEasyXTest  and  JSWUnitTest

After the software has been built, you can run:

    ./tester JEasyXTest       to draw several pre programmed
                              collections of graphical objects.

or

    ./tester JSWUnitTest      to draw a couple of examples of 
                              calculated surface contour maps.
