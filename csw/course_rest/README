This directory has some code snnipets created in response to the Udemy 
restfun api course.  I (Glenn) consider these to be useful references
for the basic syntax and logic of many spring/hibernate features.

The code smippets here use gradle to build.  I could not stomach putting
stuff requiring an eclipse based ide into this directory.

This code is not actually a part of the csw libraries.  However, putting this
stuff here makes it easier to use github for backup purposes.
