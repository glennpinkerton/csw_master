This mysql directory has batch sql scripts which will be used to create
and load tables in a mysql database.  The database is a quite simple
"spatial" database.  The goal here is to learn how to use mysql for
accessing large (over a terabyte) data sets.  The "glp" data base is not
meant to be used for any "real" work.

Only the java files, makefiles, and sql scripts are intended to be
saved in GIT.  In particular, none of the actual mysql data or files
used to load into the mysql database are controlled in GIT.
