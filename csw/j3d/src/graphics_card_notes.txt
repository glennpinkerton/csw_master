On the Nvidia Quadro fx500, you need to turn off the enhanced cpu
instruction set option in the opengl properties to avoid flakey 
behavior.

On Tom's Nvidia Gforce 2, you need to be in true color mode, not 
65k color mode, to get proper blending of transparent surfaces with
the bounding box.

Larry's ATI card is not a good choice for opengl.  The drivers are 
not well debugged and intermitently, the 3d view does not show
up initially on the mbuilder.
