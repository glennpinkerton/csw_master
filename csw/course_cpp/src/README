This directory has some code snipets created in response to the Udemy 
"Advanced C++" course.  I (Glenn) consider these to be useful references
for the basic syntax and logic of many C++ features.

This code is not actually a part of the csw libraries.  However, I use
the same make system to build these snipets, so I have put them here
under the csw directory and I am saving them in github for backup and
version control.
