/*
 * The lesson on "delegating constructors" does not seem very useful to me.
 * I strongly prefer to define all constructors needed, especially the
 * "default" constructor.  A common "init" method can be used to set 
 * variable values, and the variable = value or variable{values}
 * syntax can take care of this stuff.  I don't see any reason to use
 * the constructor1 : constructor2 syntax.  It also can produce recursion
 * if implemented wrongly.
