This is a collection of java and C++ code that does some graphics and
contour mapping stuff.  The code was originally written by Glenn Pinkerton
(glennpinkerton@comcast.net) between 1997 and 2007.  The current reincarnation
is a refactor trying to use more modern software technology.

My (Glenn's) reason for doing this is primarily to learn new technology.
The code is currently (11/21/2017) not really "ready for use".  I have put
it here on github to learn how to use github and to have everything under
a version control system

I have made two branches:  glenns_branch and testing_branch.   You should make
your own branch if you want to explore the code.

I will update/replace this README with information about relatively big changes
that I make in the code.

Any constructive comments are appreciated.


The two directories here are:

    build     Scripts to build using make.  I do not have any other build
              mechanism other than the makefiles.

    csw       This has all the code, makefiles, some data, etc.

    jutest    This has files for building and running junit tests.  There
              are very few tests.  I made these few as a start to learning
              the junit framework.


There are README files in these directories with more information.


You need to set the environment variable CSW_PARENT to the name of the
directory where this README file is located.

For example in bash:   

export CSW_PARENT=/home/git_glenns_branch/csw_master

I suggest you put this in your .bashrc file, in your home directory
or in whatever other shell init file you have.
