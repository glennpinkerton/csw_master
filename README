This is a collection of java and C++ code that does some graphics and
contour mapping stuff.  The code was originally written by Glenn Pinkerton
(glennpinkerton@comcast.net) between 1997 and 2007.  The current reincarnation
is a refactor trying to use more modern software technology.

My (Glenn's) reason for doing this is primarily to learn new technology.

As of 10/15/2018, quite a bit of the code is useful, in my opinion.  It is
not particularly well documented, but the test programs in csw/jtest give
a good starting point if anyone wants to use this stuff.

I have made two branches:  glenns_branch and testing_branch.   You should make
your own branch if you want to explore the code.  Or, clone the whole master and 
do what you want from there.

I will update/replace this README with information about relatively big changes
that I make in the code.

Any constructive comments are appreciated.


The three directories here are:

    build     Scripts to build using make.  The only mechanism for building
              everything is makefiles.  I have a simple use of gradle for
              building the JEasyXTest application as well.  The gradle build
              is in the csw/gradle directory.

    csw       This has all the code, makefiles, some data, etc.

    jutest    This has files for building and running junit tests.  There
              are very few tests.  I made these few as a start to learning
              the junit framework.  As of 10/15/2018, I doubt if I will do
              much with the jutest directory.  I'm not real impressed with
              junit.  It seems to me that it is quite a bit of tedious work
              for not much reward.


There are README files in these directories with more information.


You need to set the environment variable CSW_PARENT to the name of the
directory where this README file is located.

For example in bash:   

export CSW_PARENT=/home/git_glenns_branch/csw_master

I suggest you put this in your .bashrc file, in your home directory
or in whatever other shell init file you have.
