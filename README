This is a collection of java and C++ code that does some graphics and
contour mapping stuff.  The code was originally written by Glenn Pinkerton
(glennpinkerton@comcast.net) between 1997 and 2007.  The current reincarnation
is a refactor trying to use more modern software technology.

My (Glenn's) reason for doing this is primarily to learn new technology.
The code is currently (11/21/2017) not really "ready for use".  I have put
it here on github to learn how to use github and to have everything under
a version control system

I have made two branches:  glenns_branch and guest_branch.  If I understand
git correctly, both branches are available to anyone.  I hope people will
be courteous enough to explore the guest_branch and leave glenns_branch
alone.  Feel free to explore the guest_branch as you wish.

I will update/replace this README with information about relatively big changes
that I make in the code.

Any constructive comments are appreciated.
